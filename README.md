# Queue Management System

The Queue Management System is a web-based application designed to help a company manage queues for multiple services handled by various counters. The system allows customers to generate queue numbers for the services they need, and it helps counter workers call customers based on the queue. The application offers real-time updates and a responsive interface for users and staff.

## Features

1. **Customer Queue Number Generation:**
   - Customers can select the service they need from a touch screen interface.
   - The system generates a queue number that starts from 1 for each workday.
   - The number is displayed and can be printed.

2. **Real-Time Counter Display:**
   - The system shows active counters with the current queue number being served.
   - Updates are pushed to all interfaces in real time using **SignalR**.

3. **Counter Worker Interface:**
   - Counter workers can call the next customer from the list of previously generated numbers.
   - The next customer is selected based on the service that the counter is assigned to handle.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - **Angular**: Provides the frontend framework for building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
  - **CSS/Bootstrap**: Ensures a clean, mobile-friendly, and modern design for the application.

- **Backend:**
  - **.NET**: Manages the server-side logic, handling business rules, queue management, and communication between the frontend and database.
  - **SignalR**: Enables real-time communication between clients and servers, ensuring that updates (e.g., current numbers on counters) are reflected instantly on the display.

- **Database:**
  - **Microsoft SQL Server**: Stores data on services, counters, generated numbers, and associated metadata such as the timestamp of number generation and service types.

## System Architecture

1. **Customer Interface:**
   - Provides a list of available services.
   - Generates and prints queue numbers for customers when they select a service.

2. **Counter Display:**
   - Shows all active counters with the current queue numbers they are serving.
   - Updates in real-time as workers call the next number.

3. **Counter Worker Interface:**
   - Allows counter workers to call the next customer.
   - The system only selects customers who have generated numbers for services handled by the respective counter.

## Database Schema

- **Services**: Stores the list of services offered by the company.
- **Counters**: Stores details about counters and the services they handle.
- **GeneratedNumbers**: Stores queue numbers generated by customers, the associated service, and the timestamp of generation.
- **CounterAssignments**: Tracks which services are handled by each counter.
